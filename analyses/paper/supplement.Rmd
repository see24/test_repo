# Model of bias in recruitment estimates from calf:cow surveys

Assume each group of animals in a calf:cow composition survey contains one or more collared adult females ($T$), and may also include: uncollared adult females misidentified as young bulls or unknown sex ($U$); correctly identified uncollared adult females ($V$); young bulls correctly identified as male or unknown sex ($O$); young bulls misidentified as uncollared adult females ($P$); observed calves ($J$); and unobserved calves ($K$). The apparent number of adult females in the group is $T+V+P=Tw$, where $w$ is a multiplier that defines the apparent number of adult females as a function of the number of collared animals. Our objective is to model the sex and bias-corrected recruitment rate $X=\frac{J+K}{2(T+U+V)}$ as a function of the observed calf:cow ratio $R=J/(T+V+P)$, the cow multiplier $w$, the ratio of young bulls to adult females $q$, and the misidentification probabilities $u$ and $z$. We start by solving for $T+U+V$ as a function of $q,w,u$ and $T$. Recognize that $P=Tw-T-V$, $U+V=V/(1-u)$, and $P+O=P/u$ to write $q$ as 
$$q=\frac{Tw-T-V}{uV/(1-u)}.$$
Rearrange to get 
$$V=\frac{T(w-1)(1-u)}{qu+1-u}.$$
Recognize that $U=Vu/(1-u)$ to write $T+U+V$ as a function of $q,w,u$ and $T$: 
$$T+U+V=T\frac{qu+w-u}{qu+1-u}.$$
Recognize that the number of observed calves $J$ is the product of the apparent recruitment rate and the apparent number of adult females $J=RTw$, and that therefore $J+K=RTw/(1-z)$ to rewrite the bias corrected recruitment rate $X=\frac{J+K}{2(T+U+V)}$ as a function of $w,u,z$ and $R$:
$$X=R\frac{w(1+qu-u)}{2(w+qu-u)(1-z)}.$$
For simplicity, we write $X$ as a function of a bias correction term $c$: 
$$c=\frac{w(1+qu-u)}{(w+qu-u)(1-z)}; X=cR/2$$

```{r biasPlot, fig.cap="Variation in the sex and bias corrected recruitment rate $X$ with the cow multiplier $w$, the ratio of young bulls to adult females $q$, and the adult misidentification probability $u$, and the probability of missing a calf $z$. If only collared females are counted ($w=1$) and there is a risk of missing calves $z>0$ then the apparent recruitment rate $R$ will be lower than $X$ (first column). When uncollared animals are counted ($w>1$), the risk of misidentifying adults $u$ inflates the apparent recruitment rate $R$ as on average more cows are misidentified as bulls than vice versa, but this effect is smaller than the effect of missing calves $z$. Increasing the proportion of bulls in the group $q$ reduces the effect of adult misidentification $u$.", fig.height=6,cache=TRUE}

# Calibration of priors

We begin by setting random effects to zero, varying the prior standard deviations of the survival intercept (sIntSE is $\beta^S_0$ in Table 2) and recruitment intercept (rIntSE is $\beta^R_0$ in Table 2), and comparing the prior predictive intervals of the Bayesian model to the 95\% predictive intervals from Johnson et al.'s (2020) regression analysis in a case with no anthropogenic disturbance (top row of Fig \@ref(fig:InterceptsAndSlopes)). We set the prior standard deviation intercept parameters (sIntSE = 0.04, rIntSE = 0.25) so that the upper bounds of the Bayesian predictive intervals match the upper bounds of Johnson et al.'s predictive intervals.  

We then vary the prior standard deviations of the slopes of the relationships between anthropogenic disturbance and demographic rates (sAnthroSlopeSE is $\beta^S_R$ and rAnthroSlopeSE is $\beta^R_R$ in Table 2), and compare the prior predictive intervals of the Bayesian model to the 95\% predictive intervals from Johnson et al.'s (2020) regression analysis in a case with 90\% anthropogenic disturbance (bottom row of Fig \@ref(fig:InterceptsAndSlopes)). We set the prior standard deviation of the slopes (sAnthroSlopeSE = 0.0005, rAnthroSlopeSE = 0.006) so that the upper bound of the Bayesian predictive interval does not substantially exceed the upper bound of Johnson et al.'s predictive interval. 

The choice of priors for interannual variation in survival and recruitment are less important because these have little impact on expected population growth rate (Figs \@ref(fig:PriorAllFits) and \@ref(fig:PriorAllFitsR)). We set the prior for the coefficient of variation of survival among years $\nu_S$ to vary uniformly between sNuMin = 0.001 and sNuMax = 0.13 to match the variation among national model simulations (Fig \@ref(fig:PriorAllFits)). We set the prior for the coefficient of variation of recruitment of among years $\nu_S$ to vary uniformly between rNuMin = 0.001 and rNuMax = 0.7 to match the variation among national model simulations (Fig \@ref(fig:PriorAllFitsR)).

Given intensive monitoring (15 years of 60 collars per year) of populations where demographic rates are higher or lower than the national average (from 97.5% and 2.5% quantiles of the national model), and the slope of the anthropogenic disturbance relationship differs from the national model, these priors are vague enough to allow posteriors to reflect local demographic rates (Figs \@ref(fig:SurvBoth) and \@ref(fig:RecBoth)).

# Sensitivity to unknown bias in recruitment estimates from calf:cow surveys

Adding unknown unknown bias does increase uncertainty, but these increases are not large (compare Figs \@ref(fig:powercmult3ay3aSf1)/\@ref(fig:powercmult3ay3aSf1NoBias) and \@ref(fig:powercmult9ay3aSf1)/\@ref(fig:powercmult9ay3aSf1NoBias)). A key reason for this result is that we assumed the same range of values for the probability of misclassifying adults, and the probability of missing calves (supplement B). Presuming that surveyed groups contain more cows than bulls, and that there is an equal probability of misclassifying cows and young bulls and vice versa, then misclassification errors cause high estimated recruitment. Missing calves causes low estimated recruitment, and together these errors tend to cancel one another out.
